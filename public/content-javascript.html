  <p>These days JavaScript is <b>everywhere</b>. I started learning JavaScript in earnest at Xerox in 2007, while developing 
    control and UI software for the text fixtures I designed. At Integra in 2013, I maintained and expanded their testing 
    scripts that perform automated testing on their flagship product. These tests were written in JavaScript and 
    executed through the Windows JavaScript interpreter, wScript. After leaving Integra, I started
    <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com" target="_blank">Island Web Help</a> to do freelance website development.
    I've been working almost exclusively on <b>Full Stack</b> applications since 2015.

            “Full stack” means a lot of different things to different people. In my mind, JavaScript embodies the idea of ‘full stack’ 
            the best by creating a common programming language that seamlessly spans between the server and browser. At a minimum, 
            a ‘full stack’ application incorporates a database for persisting data, API calls to pass data between the server and 
            client browser, and a mobile-first user interface running in a client’s web browser. 
            I've worked almost exclusively on full stack application since the beginning of 2015. Here are some examples:
          <p>

              </a>
              <p>
                <a href="http://connextcms.com" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a> – One of my first tasks as lead developer at 
                <a href="http://skagitconnext.com/" target="_blank">Skagit 
                Connext</a> was to find a free or open source Content Management System (CMS) that was not WordPress. We used 
                Expression Engine CMS which comes with a $300 licensing fee. It was great for high-end web sites, but we needed 
                something mobile-friendly, simple, and <i>free</i> for our smaller customers. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I discovered <a href="http://keystonejs.com" target="_blank">KeystoneJS CMS</a>, a Node/Express/MongoDB application. 
                The core KeystoneJS engine is an elegant design.  However, the Admin UI is written in React.js and uses server-side 
                rendering. This moves the development onto the server, and I felt a better design is to keep the UI development 
                in the browser. ConnextCMS is a Backbone.js application that mimics the WordPress Admin UI using the 
                <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Control Panel Bootstrap Template</a>. 
                Data is exchanged between server and client using a REST API. 
              </p>
              <p>
                As I developed ConnextCMS, I convinced the management to release the code as open source under the MIT license. 
                We are currently in the process of trying to build momentum and recruit developers from the open source community.

                <a href="http://rpiovn.org" target="_blank">RPiOVN</a> is an acronym for Raspberry Pi Open Value Network. It's a cooperative for programmers of 
                the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi minicomputer</a> who use 
                it to develop 
                new applications and appliances. The RPiOVN dashboard pictured here is used for members of the 
                cooperative to track the amount of time they've contributed toward a project. Hours are accounted 
                and profit is distributed fairly. All time tracked is transparent to all members.

                If that sounds complicated, it is. You should probably just

              </p>
              <p>
                I created RPiOVN.org after working with similar software used by <a href="http://www.sensorica.co/" target="_blank">Sensorica</a> 
                and studying the phenomenon of <a href="http://rpiovn.org/blog/post/what-is-an-open-value-network" target="_blank">Open Value Networks</a>. 
                It's a sophisticated web application that does on-the-fly accounting and data visualization. 
                Users can easily enter information about work they've done inside the <i>/logwork</i> dashboard.
                Work entries are stored in a MongodDB database. Records can be viewed and even downloaded in Excel format by members. 
                I've <a href="https://github.com/christroutner/rpiovn" target="_blank">published all code as open source on GitHub</a>. 
                The software is packaged as a plugin for <a href="http://connextcms.com/" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a>.

                <a href="http://crumbshare.com" target="_blank">CrumbShare</a> is both a <i>web app</i> and an <i>embedded device</i>. 
                Crumb Share is a service that works in conjunction with the <a href="http://rpiovn.org/project/rpi-tracker" target="_blank">RPi-Tracker</a>, 
                a small tracking appliance. The business targets travel writers, travel bloggers, and people who adventure 
                in boats and vehicles, who want to easily share a breadcrumb trail of their travels on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the Crumb Share <i>service</i> and the RPi-Tracker <i>device</i> are spin-off products of <a href="http://rpiovn.org" target="_blank">RPi OVN</a>. 
                I created the device and started the service with a friend and fellow website designer. 
                <a href="http://connextcms.com" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a> is used to run the site as well as handle 
                the upload of data from devices scattered across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The devices automatically sync up with the server any time they come within reach of an internet WiFi signal. 
                The users breadcrumb trail is displayed on top of a Google map. Users get a link they can use to share 
                their map on social media, or a simple line of code they can use to embed it on their website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Privacy features allow users to draw keep-out circles around sensitive locations where the devices will not 
                track them. Control of the device takes place over WiFi and can be done with a smart phone or laptop. 
                Everything is programmed in JavaScript.

            This section showcases examples of my front end work. These days, every front end project I build is based on 
            the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap framework</a>. Whenever a dashboard is called for,
            my borrow heavily from the open source <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Template</a>, 
            also based on Bootstrap. I also have experience with several JavaScript frameworks, as explained below.
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Backbone.js & Require.js</h3>
              <p>
                All the apps I've listed under <i>Full Stack Development</i> 
                have been 
                based on Bootstrap.js. I also
                modularize my projects with Require.js. When collaborating on projects, I frequently reference
                <a href="https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">this open source book
                by O'Reily media.</a> It's concise, freely available, and helps other developers
                access the knowledge they need to copy the code I've developed and released as open source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Backone.js is no longer as in-vogue as React.js or Angular.js, I firmly believe that
                it is the superior framework due to its small download size, unopinionated architecture, and
                maturity. Backbone.js was battle tested and code mature before Angular or React appears on the
                scene. I believe these factors make it the lowest business risk for any organization, and
                I can do anythign with this framework that can be done with the others.

            <br>
            
            <li>
              <h3>Angular.js</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular.js</a> is a front end framework competing with 
                <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>. I've since gravitated towards Backbone.js, but the 
                examples below show the extent of the dabbling I've done with this framework. 
              </p>

                    <b><a href="http://christroutner.com/ct-v1.2/" target="_blank">v2 Of This Site!</a></b> - This is an earlier version of this site that uses the Twitter Bootstrap framework accentuated with custom JavaScript code sprinkled throughout the HTML using the Angular.js
                    framework. The Angular code can be found in <a href="http://christroutner.com/js/app.js" target="_blank">this file</a>. All the features
                    listed below are still present in the current version, but I've taken them out of Angular and implemented them with jQuery
                    calls and <a href="http://christroutner.com/js/site.js" target="_blank">frameworkless code</a>.

                    <li>
                      The collapsing panels that make up this website are native to Bootstrap, but the animation of the '+' and '-' signs is custom code 
                      attached to panel elements with another custom Angular Directive.

              <h3>React.js</h3>
              <p>
                React.js is often described at the 'V' (View) in MVC. It is also frequently used in Backbone.js projects to replace the navtive Backbone Views.
                Backbone Views have been more than adaquate to meet my UI needs in previous projects, and for this reason I have limited experience with React.js.
                I've completed a course offered by <a href="http://codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a> on the React.js library and I'm in the process of converting this site into a Backbone app with
                the views replaced by React.js, in order to gain some experience with the library.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be honest, I'm skeptical of React.js. I understand its advantages, but I don't think most people understand
                it's disadvantages. For example, 
                <a href="https://medium.com/@raulk/if-youre-a-startup-you-should-not-use-react-reflecting-on-the-bsd-patents-license-b049d4a67dd2?ref=stackshare" target="_blank">this article</a> 
                provides some very good reasons and references why using a
                non-free framework like React.js could be bad for your business. And of course, why use a new, risky framework
                when a stable, lightweight, low-risk one like Backbone.js is available? 
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to React's popularity though, as a freelance developer, I can't afford to ignore it. And so, I am working dilligently to bring myself up to speed
                and explore the universe of React components. This section will be expanded with some of the my favorite UI components that I come across.

              <h3>Google Maps API</h3>
              <p>
                I've been interested in GPS and Google Maps for several years. I've taught myself the ins and outs of the 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Map API</a>. 
                Over the last few years 
                I've also been playing with embedded tracking devices and learning how to integrate them 
                with a Google Map. Below are examples of Google Map application prototypes I've built, which have a 
                front-end and server-side component.

                  <a href="SPOTMap.html" target="_blank">SPOT Tracker Map</a> - I wrote this application to display a sliding window of GPS data from my SPOT tracker. 
                  I used it to keep track of my four-month sailing journey in 2015 and to share my location  with readers of 
                  <a href="http://sanjuansufficiency.com" target="_blank">my 
                    sailing blog</a>. The code controlling the Google Map and slider controls

                    With comments, it's under 200 lines of code.

                  my interest with Raspberry Pi minicomputers and tracking devices merged to create the

                  is an elaborate animation with the purpose of conveying the services I can offer to potential clients.  Unlike a video, viewers
                  don't have to worry about buffering or resolution downgrades. The animation uses jQuery calls for all the manipulation,
                  and using the Bootstrap framework ensures that the animation looks good on all different sizes of screens. The animation
                  relies heavily on the <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a> library.

            I became interested in Node (or Node.js) and the Express.js framework for its ability to execute Back-end/Server-side functions with programs 
            written in JavaScript.
            This is handy in many places, but my personal interest was in open-source, embedded web servers such as the 
            <a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>.
          <p>
          <p>
            There has been an explosion of cheap, 
	          networked, 32-bit mini-computers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, as well as the growing trend of 
            the Internet of Things (IoT). I believe that JavaScript provides the tools to build awesome web-based 
            user interfaces for IoT devices and server-side JavaScript (like Node.js) allows for control of those 
            embedded devices too. I started <a href="http://rpiovn.org" target="_blank">RPiOVN</a> as a social planform for Raspberry Pi
            developers to collaborate on potential new vetures. Here are some of the projects I've started
            through that organization:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a href="http://rpiovn.org/project/rpi-tracker" target="_blank">RPi-Tracker</a> - 
                This project uses a minimum amount of hardware to create a GPS tracking device. The Pi acts as a WiFi 
                access point, allowing cell phones and computers to communicate with it directly. Configuration 
                and downloading of files takes place over a web browser. A GPS is used to retrieve tracking data. 
                Data is saved in GeoJSON format, but can be downloaded in GeoJSON, KML, or GPX format.
              </p>
              <p>
                The RPi-Tracker can work as a stand-alone device, but is intended to be used with the 
                <a href="http://crumbshare.org" target="_blank">Crumb Share service</a> that allows you 
                to easily share your adventures on your blog or via social media. Target users are 
                boaters, RVs and vans, travel writers, and anyone needing to easily capture and share 
                GPS-based data.

                <a href="http://rpiovn.org/project/rpi-broker" target="_blank">RPi-Broker</a> - 
                RPi Broker aspires to create a marketplace offering Virtal Private Servers (VPS), similar to 
                <a href="http://digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> or 
                <a href="http://vultr.com/" target="_blank">Vultr</a>. This would also be similar to co-location 
                services like <a href="https://raspberry-hosting.com/en" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Hosting</a> 
                or <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi" target="_blank">Mythic Beasts</a>. However, 
                instead of using a data center, the marketplace would use an array of psudo-anonymous Raspberry Pi 
                or other IoT devices hosted by people participating in a marketplace. Anyone with an internet 
                connection and a device capable of running Docker can rent that device in the RPi Broker marketplace.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the <a href="https://raspberry-hosting.com/en/applications" target="_blank">applications of such a network</a> 
                are similar, the RPi Broker marketplace will never have the speed or reliabilty of the commercial 
                outfits linked above. Instead, the focus of RPi Broker is to create a decentralized network for 
                censor-proof, anonymous web servers, capable of delivering websites or web apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine being able to spin up multiple copies of your server, in multiple locations, in a matter 
                of seconds, all hundreds of times faster than any government could censor them. And the servers 
                can be paid for with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, so as long as you're carefull in how you
                obtain that cryptocurrency, you could create the servers anonymously, without any paper trail 
                back to you. Due to a strongly encrypted Docker container, the people hosting the physical 
                device have no way to know what is being served or ability to access the files on the device. 
                That's the focus of the RPi Broker network. In this way, RPi Broker is censhorship-fighting 
                software similar to, but very different from, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">TOR</a>.

          <p>At Xerox I wrote test scripts in JavaScript that would run functional tests on the circuit board sub-components of their printer products. As the
            circuit boards would reach the end of the assembly line, prior to final assembly, they would be put into a test fixture. A bed of needles would be
            lowered onto the circuit board and connect it to a computer on the test fixture. I designed the interface hardware, programmed the embedded microcontrollers in C++, and wrote the
            functional testing software on the computer in JavaScript. The software would put the circuit board through its paces and catalog any unexpected
            behavior. Tests were prioritized and results uploaded to a database on a central server for data mining. These fixtures were essential for Xerox's six-sigma
            management strategy and warranty insurance research.</p><br>

            <p>My position at Integra was as a software tester. About half my job was manual testing and the other half I spent on maintaining their suite
            of automated testing scripts, written in JavaScript. During my time there, I added dozens of test cases, made several improvements to the utility
            libraries, and assisted in the design and build out of a Build Verification Test (BVT) program that automated the testing of the nightly build.</p>
