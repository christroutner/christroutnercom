  <p>These days JavaScript is <b>everywhere</b>. I started learning JavaScript in earnest at Xerox in 2007, while developing 
    control and UI software for the text fixtures I designed. At Integra in 2013, I maintained and expanded their testing 
    scripts that perform automated testing on their flagship product. These tests were written in JavaScript and 
    executed through the Windows JavaScript interpreter, wScript. After leaving Integra, I started
    <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com" target="_blank">Island Web Help</a> to do freelance website development.
    I've been working almost exclusively on <b>Full Stack</b> applications since 2015.

            “Full stack” means a lot of different things to different people. In my mind, JavaScript embodies the idea of ‘full stack’ 
            the best by creating a common programming language that seamlessly spans between the server and browser. At a minimum, 
            a ‘full stack’ application incorporates a database for persisting data, API calls to pass data between the server and 
            client browser, and a mobile-first user interface running in a client’s web browser. 
            I've worked almost exclusively on full stack application since the beginning of 2015. Here are some examples:
          <p>

          <ul class="xs-no-bullet">

              </a>
              <p>
                <a href="http://connextcms.com" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a> – One of my first tasks as lead developer at 
                <a href="http://skagitconnext.com/" target="_blank">Skagit 
                Connext</a> was to find a free or open source Content Management System (CMS) that was not WordPress. We used 
                Expression Engine CMS which comes with a $300 licensing fee. It was great for high-end web sites, but we needed 
                something mobile-friendly, simple, and <i>free</i> for our smaller customers. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I discovered <a href="http://keystonejs.com" target="_blank">KeystoneJS CMS</a>, a Node/Express/MongoDB application. 
                The core KeystoneJS engine is an elegant design.  However, the Admin UI is written in React.js and uses server-side 
                rendering. This moves the development onto the server, and I felt a better design is to keep the UI development 
                in the browser. ConnextCMS is a Backbone.js application that mimics the WordPress Admin UI using the 
                <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Control Panel Bootstrap Template</a>. 
                Data is exchanged between server and client using a REST API. 
              </p>
              <p>
                As I developed ConnextCMS, I convinced the management to release the code as open source under the MIT license. 
                We are currently in the process of trying to build momentum and recruit developers from the open source community.

                <a href="http://rpiovn.org" target="_blank">RPiOVN</a> is an acronym for Raspberry Pi Open Value Network. It's a cooperative for programmers of 
                the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi minicomputer</a> who use 
                it to develop 
                new applications and appliances. The RPiOVN dashboard pictured here is used for members of the 
                cooperative to track the amount of time they've contributed toward a project. Hours are accounted 
                and profit is distributed fairly. All time tracked is transparent to all members.

                If that sounds complicated, it is. You should probably just

              </p>
              <p>
                I created RPiOVN.org after working with similar software used by <a href="http://www.sensorica.co/" target="_blank">Sensorica</a> 
                and studying the phenomenon of <a href="http://rpiovn.org/blog/post/what-is-an-open-value-network" target="_blank">Open Value Networks</a>. 
                It's a sophisticated web application that does on-the-fly accounting and data visualization. 
                Users can easily enter information about work they've done inside the <i>/logwork</i> dashboard.
                Work entries are stored in a MongodDB database. Records can be viewed and even downloaded in Excel format by members. 
                I've <a href="https://github.com/christroutner/rpiovn" target="_blank">published all code as open source on GitHub</a>.

                <a href="http://crumbshare.com" target="_blank">CrumbShare</a> is both a <i>web app</i> and an <i>embedded device</i>. 
                Crumb Share is a service that works in conjunction with the <a href="http://rpiovn.org/project/rpi-tracker" target="_blank">RPi-Tracker</a>, 
                a small tracking appliance. The business targets travel writers, travel bloggers, and people who adventure 
                in boats and vehicles, who want to easily share a breadcrumb trail of their travels on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the Crumb Share <i>service</i> and the RPi-Tracker <i>device</i> are spin-off products of <a href="http://rpiovn.org" target="_blank">RPi OVN</a>. 
                I created the device and started the service with a friend and fellow website designer. 
                <a href="http://connextcms.com" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a> is used to run the site as well as handle 
                the upload of data from devices scattered across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The devices automatically sync up with the server any time they come within reach of an internet WiFi signal. 
                The users breadcrumb trail is displayed on top of a Google map. Users get a link they can use to share 
                their map on social media, or a simple line of code they can use to embed it on their website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Privacy features allow users to draw keep-out circles around sensitive locations where the devices will not 
                track them. Control of the device takes place over WiFi and can be done with a smart phone or laptop. 
                Everything is programmed in JavaScript.

            This section showcases examples of my front end work. These days, every front end project I build is based on 
            the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap framework</a>. Whenever a dashboard is called for,
            my borrow heavily from the open source <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Template</a>, 
            also based on Bootstrap. I also have experience with several JavaScript frameworks, as explained below.
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Backbone.js & Require.js</h3>
              <p>
                All the apps I've listed under <i>Full Stack Development</i> 
                have been 
                based on Bootstrap.js. I also
                modularize my projects with Require.js. When collaborating on projects, I frequently reference
                <a href="https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">this open source book
                by O'Reily media.</a> It's concise, freely available, and helps other developers
                access the knowledge they need to copy the code I've developed and released as open source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Backone.js is no longer as in-vogue as React.js or Angular.js, I firmly believe that
                it is the superior framework due to its small download size, unopinionated architecture, and
                maturity. Backbone.js was battle tested and code mature before Angular or React appears on the
                scene. I believe these factors make it the lowest business risk for any organization, and
                I can do anythign with this framework that can be done with the others.
              </p>

            <br>
            
            <li>
              <h3>Angular.js</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular.js</a> is a front end framework competing with 
                <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>. I've since gravitated towards Backbone.js, but the 
                examples below show the extent of the dabbling I've done with this framework. 
              </p>

                    framework. The Angular code can be found in <a href="http://christroutner.com/js/app.js" target="_blank">this file</a>. All the features
                    listed below are still present in the current version, but I've taken them out of Angular and implemented them with jQuery
                    calls and <a href="http://christroutner.com/js/site.js" target="_blank">frameworkless code</a>.

                      The collapsing panels that make up this website are native to Bootstrap, but the animation of the '+' and '-' signs is custom code

              <p>
                I've been interested in GPS and Google Maps for several years. I've taught myself the ins and outs of the 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Map API</a>. 
                Over the last few years 
                I've also been playing with embedded tracking devices and learning how to integrate them 
                with a Google Map. Below are examples of Google Map application prototypes I've built, which have a front-end and back-end component.
              </p>

                <li>
                  <a href="SPOTMap.html" target="_blank">SPOT Tracker Map</a> - I wrote this application to display a sliding window of GPS data from my SPOT tracker. 
                  I used it to keep track of my four-month sailing journey in 2015 and to share my location  with readers of 
                  <a href="http://sanjuansufficiency.com" target="_blank">my

                  my interest with Raspberry Pi minicomputers and tracking devices merged to create the

                  <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com/old/animation.html" target="_blank">this HTML/JavaScript animation</a>. It 
                  is an elaborate animation with the purpose of conveying the services I can offer to potential clients.  Unlike a video, viewers
                  don't have to worry about buffering or resolution downgrades. The animation uses jQuery calls for all the manipulation,
                  and using the Bootstrap framework ensures that the animation looks good on all different sizes of screens. The animation
                  relies heavily on the <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a> library.

            I became interested in Node (or Node.js) and the Express.js framework for its ability to execute Back-end/Server-side functions with programs 
            written in JavaScript.
            This is handy in many places, but my personal interest was in open-source, embedded web servers such as the 
            <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>.
            For purposes of demonstration on this site, I ported the code to Node servers running Windows 2008 Server in the Amazon EC2 Cloud, 
            then later moved the same code to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> Droplets running Ubuntu Linux. Because the code is in JavaScript and Node runs 
            on all these operating systems, no code changes were necessary.

                <a href="SPOTMap.html" target="_blank">SPOT Tracker Map</a> - The server linked to my SPOT satellite tracker data is published as an XML file. Only the last 50 data points are available. 
                As new data comes in, old data is discarded, but I never use more than 50 data points in a day. 
                I wrote an application in Node that downloads the XML file and parses the data into a CSV file. 
                This data is then retrieved by the client-side JavaScript running in the Client's browser.

                <a href="http://christroutner.com:3000/MultipleMaps.html" target="_blank">Collaborative Geo-Data</a> - This is a prototype Google 
                Maps web app that allows users to collaboratively update a common database of geographical data. I had intended to use this 
                application to allow other boaters to share information about anchorages in remote locations and sources of wild food nearby. 
                Unfortunately <a href="https://activecaptain.com" target="_blank">Active Captain</a> came up with this idea before me. I decided 
                to release the code as Open Source under the GNUv2 license.

                Geo-Data for this map is stored in a CSV file. However, the two additional Client pages contain forms that allow users to 
                <a href="http://christroutner.com/AddNew.html" target="_blank">create new map markers</a> and update existing map markers. 
                These forms make POST and GET requests to a custom web-service written in JavaScript and running in Node. These services 
                update the CSV file, allowing for collaborative editing of the database.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code examples never progressed past the prototyping stage, so it used simple CSV files for data storage. For scalability, a database would normally be used, but CSV is great for small websites and quick prototyping.

                RPi-Tracker & RPiOVN.com – <a href="http://rpiovn.org/" target="_blank">RPi OVN</a> is an 
                <a href="http://rpiovn.org/blog/post/what-is-an-open-value-network" target="_blank">Open Value Network</a> that I created 
                after working with the developers of the <a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork" target="_blank">Network Resource Planning (NRP)</a> 
                accounting software used by <a href="http://www.sensorica.co/" target="_blank">Sensorica</a>. The easiest way to think about 
                it is a co-op for Raspberry Pi programmers to develop products together and share in the profits. It’s an experiment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The first product RPiOVN will be launching in the <a href="http://rpiovn.org/page/rpi-tracking-device" target="_blank">RPi-Tracker</a>. It’s simply a USB GPS hooked up to Raspberry Pi, but everything is controlled via a Node/Express.js app, and the user interface is simple web page using Bootstrap and jQuery. The Raspberry Pi can be switched between a Wifi Client and Access Point modes, allowing communication and control directly from a cell phone over WiFi. Data can easily be downloaded and uploaded to Google Maps. The intended audience is boaters and RVers who want a cheap, dedicated tracking device for sharing their travels.

          <p>At Xerox I wrote test scripts in JavaScript that would run functional tests on the circuit board sub-components of their printer products. As the
            circuit boards would reach the end of the assembly line, prior to final assembly, they would be put into a test fixture. A bed of needles would be
            lowered onto the circuit board and connect it to a computer on the test fixture. I designed the interface hardware, programmed the embedded microcontrollers in C++, and wrote the
            functional testing software on the computer in JavaScript. The software would put the circuit board through its paces and catalog any unexpected
            behavior. Tests were prioritized and results uploaded to a database on a central server for data mining. These fixtures were essential for Xerox's six-sigma
            management strategy and warranty insurance research.</p><br>

            <p>My position at Integra was as a software tester. About half my job was manual testing and the other half I spent on maintaining their suite
            of automated testing scripts, written in JavaScript. During my time there, I added dozens of test cases, made several improvements to the utility
            libraries, and assisted in the design and build out of a Build Verification Test (BVT) program that automated the testing of the nightly build.</p>
