  <p>These days JavaScript is <b>everywhere</b>. I started learning JavaScript in earnest at Xerox while developing control and UI software for the text fixtures I designed. At Integra I maintained and expanded their testing scripts that perform automated testing on their flagship product. These tests were written in JavaScript and executed through the Windows Script interpreter, wScript.</p> 

  <p>I have used JavaScript to create animated and Responsive webpages (like this one) for several years, but began to spend significant effort in 2013 expanding my knowledge of both front and back end libraries, as well as communication protocols like REST APIs and AJAX calls. There has been an explosion of cheap, networked, 32-bit mini-computers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, as well as the growing trend of the Internet of Things (IoT). I believe that JavaScript provides the tools to build awesome web-based user interfaces for IoT devices and server-side JavaScript (like Node.js) allows for control of those embedded devices too. I am currently playing with a Raspberry Pi to develop an embedded webserver that can remotely read sensors and actuate switches, all controlled with JavaScript.

          <p>At Xerox I wrote test scripts in JavaScript that would run functional tests on the circuit board sub-components of their printer products. As the
            circuit boards would reach the end of the assembly line, prior to final assembly, they would be put into a test fixture. A bed of needles would be
            lowered onto the circuit board and connect it to a computer on the test fixture. I designed the interface hardware, programmed the embedded microcontrollers in C++, and wrote the
            functional testing software on the computer in JavaScript. The software would put the circuit board through its paces and catalog any unexpected
            behavior. Tests were prioritized and results uploaded to a database on a central server for data mining. These fixtures were essential for Xerox's six-sigma
            management strategy and warranty insurance research.</p><br>

            <p>My position at Integra was as a software tester. About half my job was manual testing and the other half I spent on maintaining their suite
            of automated testing scripts, written in JavaScript. During my time there, I added dozens of test cases, made several improvements to the utility
            libraries, and assisted in the design and build out of a Build Verification Test (BVT) program that automated the testing of the nightly build.</p>

            This section showcases examples of my front end work. These days, every front end project I build is based on 
            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter’s Bootstrap framework</a>. In the last few months, 
            I’ve been borrowing heavily from the open source <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Template</a>, 
            also based on Bootstrap.

            In its present state, this site runs on top of the <a href="http://keystonejs.com/" target="_blank">KeystoneJS CMS</a> 
            and does not use a front end framework. You can view a previous version of this site below that was built using the 
            Angular.js framework. In my last few projects, I’ve gravitated away from Angular.js in favor of Backbone.js. 
            I appreciate Backbone’s light weight and unopinionated structure. There is nothing wrong with Angular, and 
            I am comfortable coding with that framework. Deciding to use one over the other comes down to personal preference, 
            but <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Projects-and-Companies-using-Backbone" target="_blank">
            I am not alone in my choice</a>.

              <p>
                I've been interested in GPS and Google Maps for several years. Over the last two years I've taught myself the ins and outs of the 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Map API</a>. Over the last year 
                I've also been playing with a SPOT Satellite tracking device and learning how to integrate it 
                with a Google Map. Below are examples of Google Map application prototypes I've built, which have a front-end and back-end component.
              </p>

                <li>
                  <a href="SPOTMap.html" target="_blank">SPOT Tracker Map</a> - I wrote this application to display a sliding window of GPS data from my SPOT tracker. 
                  I used it to keep track of my four-month sailing journey in 2015 and to share my location  with readers of 
                  <a href="http://sanjuansufficiency.com" target="_blank">my 
                    sailing blog</a>. The code controlling the Google Map and slider controls

                  <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com/old/animation.html" target="_blank">this HTML/JavaScript animation</a>. It 
                  is an elaborate animation with the purpose of conveying the services I can offer to potential clients.  Unlike a video, viewers
                  don't have to worry about buffering or resolution downgrades. The animation uses jQuery calls for all the manipulation,
                  and using the Bootstrap framework ensures that the animation looks good on all different sizes of screens. The animation
                  relies heavily on the <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a> library.

                <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular.js</a> is a front end framework competing with 
                <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>. I've since gravitated towards Backbone.js, but the 
                examples below show the extent of the dabbling I've done with this framework.

                  framework. The Angular code can be found in <a href="http://christroutner.com/ct-v1.2/js/app.js" target="_blank">this file</a>. All the features
                    listed below are still present in the current version, but I've taken them out of Angular and implemented them with jQuery

            I became interested in Node (or Node.js) and the Express.js framework for its ability to execute Back-end/Server-side functions with programs 
            written in JavaScript.
            This is handy in many places, but my personal interest was in open-source, embedded web servers such as the 
            <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>.
            For purposes of demonstration on this site, I ported the code to Node servers running Windows 2008 Server in the Amazon EC2 Cloud, 
            then later moved the same code to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> Droplets running Ubuntu Linux. Because the code is in JavaScript and Node runs 
            on all these operating systems, no code changes were necessary.

                <a href="SPOTMap.html" target="_blank">SPOT Tracker Map</a> - The server linked to my SPOT satellite tracker data is published as an XML file. Only the last 50 data points are available. 
                As new data comes in, old data is discarded, but I never use more than 50 data points in a day. 
                I wrote an application in Node that downloads the XML file and parses the data into a CSV file. 
                This data is then retrieved by the client-side JavaScript running in the Client's browser.

                <a href="http://christroutner.com:3000/MultipleMaps.html" target="_blank">Collaborative Geo-Data</a> - This is a prototype Google 
                Maps web app that allows users to collaboratively update a common database of geographical data. I had intended to use this 
                application to allow other boaters to share information about anchorages in remote locations and sources of wild food nearby. 
                Unfortunately <a href="https://activecaptain.com" target="_blank">Active Captain</a> came up with this idea before me. I decided 
                to release the code as Open Source under the GNUv2 license.
              </p>
              <p>
                Geo-Data for this map is stored in a CSV file. However, the two additional Client pages contain forms that allow users to 
                <a href="http://christroutner.com/AddNew.html" target="_blank">create new map markers</a> and update existing map markers. 
                These forms make POST and GET requests to a custom web-service written in JavaScript and running in Node. These services 
                update the CSV file, allowing for collaborative editing of the database.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code examples never progressed past the prototyping stage, so it used simple CSV files for data storage. For scalability, a database would normally be used, but CSV is great for small websites and quick prototyping.

                The first product RPiOVN will be launching in the <a href="http://rpiovn.org/page/rpi-tracking-device" target="_blank">RPi-Tracker</a>. It’s simply a USB GPS hooked up to Raspberry Pi, but everything is controlled via a Node/Express.js app, and the user interface is simple web page using Bootstrap and jQuery. The Raspberry Pi can be switched between a Wifi Client and Access Point modes, allowing communication and control directly from a cell phone over WiFi. Data can easily be downloaded and uploaded to Google Maps. The intended audience is boaters and RVers who want a cheap, dedicated tracking device for sharing their travels.

            “Full stack” means a lot of different things to different people. In my mind, JavaScript embodies the idea of ‘full stack’ 
            the best by creating a common programming language that seamlessly spans between the server and client browser. At a minimum, 
            a ‘full stack’ application incorporates a database for persisting data, API calls to pass data between the server and 
            client browser, and a mobile-first user interface running in a client’s web browser. The majority of work I’ve done in 
            2015 to present has been the development of full stack applications that fit this description. Here are some examples:

                <a href="http://connextcms.com" target="_blank">ConnextCMS</a> – One of my first tasks as lead developer at 
                <a href="http://skagitconnext.com/" target="_blank">Skagit 
                Connext</a> was to find a free or open source Content Management System (CMS) that was not WordPress. We used 
                Expression Engine CMS which comes with a $300 licensing fee. It was great for high-end web sites, but we needed 
                something mobile-friendly, simple, and <i>free</i> for our smaller customers. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I discovered <a href="http://keystonejs.com" target="_blank">KeystoneJS CMS</a>, a Node/Express/MongoDB application. 
                The core KeystoneJS engine is an elegant design.  However, the Admin UI is written in React.js uses server-side 
                rendering. This moves the development onto the server, and I felt a better design is to keep the UI development 
                in the browser. ConnextCMS is a Backbone.js application that mimics the WordPress Admin UI using the 
                <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview" target="_blank">AdminLTE Control Panel Bootstrap Template</a>. 
                Data is exchanged between server and client using a REST API. 
              </p>
              <p>
                As I developed ConnextCMS, I convinced the management to release the code as open source under the MIT license. 
                We are currently in the process of trying to build momentum and recruit developers from the open source community.
