  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site is used to display examples of my work for potential employers. It's highly technical;
    a place to let my inner geek really shine. For a more layman description of my work, check out the website for my freelance business:
    <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com" target="_blank">Island Web Help</a>. That site contains many examples of the work displayed here, but it's not so technical. If you want to see what latest
    piece of technology has captured my interest, be sure to check out <a href="http://christroutner.com/blog">the blog section</a>, which
    I use to write tutorials and share information with the different open source groups that I work with.

  <h3>JavaScript</h3></a>
  <p>
    I am a <b>Website Designer</b> and <b>Full Stack Programmer</b> focusing on <b>JavaScript</b> as the language of choice in all parts of the software stack. I have used JavaScript for front-end development using the latest libraries like <b>jQuery</b>, the <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a> frameworks, and front end templates like Twitter <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/" target="_blank">AdminLTE</a>. I have used JavaScript to develop back-end resources using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express.js</a>, and <a href="https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. I'm expert at using communication schemes like AJAX and REST APIs to communicate between back and front ends. Examples of code I've written can be found below.
  </p>
  <p>
    A large part of my career has been spent focusing on electronic hardware design and testing, but I have literally been writing software since I was a child. My focus on JavaScript started at Xerox, where I used it to automate the testing of both hardware and software of embedded devices. In 2013 I joined an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">Agile Scrum</a> team at Integra and fell in love with the Scrum business model. At Integra I maintained their automated testing library, written in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, at Skagit Publishing, I am the lead web designer and fullstack programmer, designing and maintaining websites for the newspaper's advertising clients. I customized the <a href="http://keystonejs.com/" target="_blank">KeystoneJS CMS</a> for our client's needs. KeystoneJS is an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">MEAN</a> application using Node, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. Front end websites are designed using jQuery, Bootstrap, and the Angular.js or Backbone.js frameworks. My department is essentially a company within a company. Highly autonomous, we provide web design and marketing service when an advertising client also needs a website. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    I'm constantly taking courses at <a href="http://codeschool.com" target='_blank'>Code School</a> to stay informed about the latest libraries and changes to the entire development stack. I've also been giving myself exercises programming an embedded web server (A <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>) with software written in Node.js.

    <h3>Web Design &amp; SEO</h3></a>
  <p>
    Over the years I've developed several websites for both myself and clients. In 2010 I joined <a href="http://thekeywordacademy.com/" target="_blank">The Keyword Academy</a> and was mentored by Courtney Tuttle.
    Court has a proven track record of making large amounts of money using white-hat SEO, despite all the updates to Google's ranking algorithm over the years.
    He is a true white-hat SEO expert. <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseWebDev" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseWebDev">This section</a> gives examples of the Responsive websites I've designed as well as some of the SEO techniques I regularly deploy for my clients. You can also view the website for my freelance web design business: <a href="http://islandwebhelp.com" target="_blank">Island Web Help</a>.

    <h3>Embedded Software</h3></a>
  <p>For about a decade I was obsessed with robotics and was sure that this was the career path for me. I've since gravitated toward software and web technology, but still use a lot of the skills I developed in embedded software. The majority of the software I wrote was in C++, but I am also competent in BASIC and assembly when needed. I do a lot of simulation in Matlab.</p>

    <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3></a>
  <p>The majority of my career has been spent in the field of electrical engineering. For three years I worked at the PACCAR Technical Center, which owns the Kenworth and Peterbilt line of semi-trucks. I was put in charge of validating their battery, alternator, starter, and exterior lighting systems. I designed and built test fixtures that would perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_accelerated_life_test" target="_blank">HALT tests</a> in order to assess a components reliability for warranty.</p>

  <p>Prior to working at PACCAR, I worked at Xerox and designed similar, but smaller and more advanced test harnesses for the functional testing of circuit boards as they came off the assembly line. At each company, the test fixtures used a combination of motors, sensors, microcontrollers, and high level PC control. At PACCAR I took several courses on Six Sigma and Reliability Management. I exercised my knack for statistical analysis.
